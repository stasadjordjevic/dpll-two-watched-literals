# DPLL Two-Literal Watching SAT Solver

**Implementation of a DPLL SAT solver with the Two-Literal Watching scheme**  
This repository contains an implementation of a SAT solver based on the **DPLL (Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland)** algorithm, enhanced with the **Two-Literal Watching** scheme for efficient unit propagation. The project demonstrates both the algorithmic procedure and practical programming techniques for handling propositional formulas in **CNF (Conjunctive Normal Form)**.

This work is a **seminar project** prepared for the course *Automated Reasoning* at the **Faculty of Mathematics, University of Belgrade**.  

The repository also includes **documentation in Serbian** describing the implementation and methodology.
